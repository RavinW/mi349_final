    <p>Recently I watched Shawn Alexander Allen speak at a Game Developers Conference about 
        “Breaking Marginalized CharacterNarrative Molds to Write Better, Richer Characters.” 
        There are quite a few topics from this video that I found really interesting, but I'm 
        only going to touch on a few.</p>

    <p>My main takeaway from the video is that the gaming industry needs to stop catering to systemic racism. 
        A lot of the storymodes that I’ve played throughout the years share a common theme of  
        having a white, cis gender, male character as the protagonist, while having little to no 
        representation of minority characters whatsoever. When it comes to the depiction of minority characters 
        in games, especially black characters, they almost always fall into one of three stereotypes: athletes, 
        gang members or some other type of bad guy.</p>
    
    <p>Even when you look at the storyline in Detroit Become Human,  Markus, the black protagonist, went from 
        being a caring, identity crisis---having android, to a one dimensional, revolutionary android jesus, who 
        becomes public enemy number one to whoever he does not make happy. How Markus is portrayed throughout the 
        game shows how, although he is supposed to be a leader, he is still depicted as a bad guy.</p>

    <p>In my opinion, the lack of positive representation or even in-depth character development of minorities in games, 
        shows how a lot of developers in the industry view minorities as nothing more than props that have no real value 
        other than to move their story along or show how “diverse and inclusive” their game is.</p>

    <p>There’s also the issue of digital blackface in online multiplayer games. Non-black people creating black characters
        to mock black people and make racist/derogatory comments is a serious ongoing problem, notably, in the NBA2K and
        GTA community. This issue has been brought up numerous times to game devs and yet, no real effort has been made
        to address it, which leads me to believe that they,along with any other developers that continue to ignore the 
        issue, are okay with enabling racism and cultural appropriation in their games, so long as they’re getting paid.
